    This simple web app was designed to help visualize a leet code challenge associated
    with finding the shortest path in a matrix from one coord to another coord while
    ensuring the path included one or more other coords. In this case, the story was that
    a dog was trying to find its way home as quickly as possible while getting all the food
    he could find along the way.

    You can adjust the speed (how much delay) is involved in the animation which
    illustrates the path logic. Lower speeds mean the animation runs faster.
  </p>
  <p class="description-p">
    Press the 'Run Search' button to start the pathing animation. The shortest
    identified route will be represented by blue borders.
